Calculator , Starting To write the Map for myself

think about to make a specific svg inside your display (done)

why when i am translating the margin top is just changing in my eyes not bottem

or right???


next step is that i open the window that people can see the result of calculation

first build the window 


now bottoms :

how to show them?? need an array from zero to 9

i can make gs and add to them this array and place them in the right place.

the x of each bottoms from 1 to 9 ...(how to place them??) donee







finish the interface:

think about having an array with objects(inside each one one array)

or an array of arrays to put each bottem as a rectangle



Strat to apply the operations :

 first apply if every one would click on something , the result would be shown in the console(done)

what should i do now ??????? function for different operationsssssss 

e.target i couldnt append my data ???? why??????




I have to apply Zero and also C (TO MAKE THE RESULT zERO)

APPLY THE DECIMAL ALSO..... (.)

AND THEN SHOWS TO THE BIG RECTANGLE 


THERE IS A PROBLEM WHY AFTER RESULT AND PRESSING = ,, I CAN PRESS AGAIN?? I CAN NOT LOCK THE SECOND NUMBER ??? 



How to put (.) between the numbers for the first number and for the second number ??????????

how to apply the decimal???
